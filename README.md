# ***V**oice **o**ver **W**eb-**W**uzl*
... is a new and polished version of my older program [***V**oice **o**ver **W**uzl*](https://github.com/Spi3lot/VoiceOverWuzl)

This newer version of the project uses Kotlin and WebSockets instead of Java and low-level Sockets

It's a simple VoIP program for voice communication, supporting features like joining channels, leaving them again (of course) and muting yourself.
Most of the things talked about here are can only be found in the [gui branch](https://github.com/Spi3lot/voww/tree/gui), because some features are still broken or have yet to be tested.
